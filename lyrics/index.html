    <h1>IN THE NIGHT</h1>
    <h2>The Weeknd</h2>

    <p1>All alone, she was livin'</p1>
    <p1>In a world without an end or beginnin'</p1>
    <p1>Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'</p1>
    <p1>But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh</p1>
    <p1>And all the wrongs she committed</p1>
    <p1>She was numb and she was so co-dependent</p1>
    <p1>She was young and all she had was the city</p1>
    <p1>But I don't mind, I don't mind</p1>
    
    <p2>And I know (Know)</p2>
    <p2>That she's capable of anything, it's riveting</p2>
    <p2>But when (When)</p2>
    <p2>You wake up, she's always gone, gone, gone, oh</p2>

    <p3>In the night, she hears him calling</p3>
    <p3>In the night, she's dancin' to relieve the pain</p3>
    <p3>She'll never walk away</p3>
    <p3>I don't think you understand</p3>
    <p3>In the night, when she comes crawlin'</p3>
    <p3>Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face</p3>
    <p3>She'll never walk away</p3>
    <p3>I don't think you understand</p3>

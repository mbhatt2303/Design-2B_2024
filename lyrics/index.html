    <h2
    class="allerta-stencil-regular">The Weeknd</h2>

    <p>All alone, she was livin'</p>
    <p>In a world without an end or beginnin'</p>
    <p>Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'</p>
    <p>But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh</p>
    <p>And all the wrongs she committed</p>
    <p>She was numb and she was so co-dependent</p>
    <p>She was young and all she had was the city</p>
    <p>But I don't mind, I don't mind</p>
    
    <p>............................................</p>

    <p>And I know (Know)</p>
    <p>That she's capable of anything, it's riveting</p>
    <p>But when (When)</p>
    <p>You wake up, she's always gone, gone, gone, oh</p>

    <p>............................................</p>

    <p>In the night, she hears him calling</p>
    <p>In the night, she's dancin' to relieve the pain</p>
    <p>She'll never walk away</p>
    <p>I don't think you understand</p>
    <p>In the night, when she comes crawlin'</p>
    <p>Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face</p>
    <p>She'll never walk away</p>
    <p>I don't think you understand</p>

    <p>............................................</p>
